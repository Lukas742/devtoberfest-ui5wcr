    "comment": "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a decent movie that delivers on the action and dinosaur thrills, but it falls short in terms of story and character development. The plot feels a bit recycled, the characters are underdeveloped, and the ending is unsatisfying. Still, it's worth watching for the impressive visuals.",
