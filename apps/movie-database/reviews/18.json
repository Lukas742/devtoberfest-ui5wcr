    "comment": "Star Wars Ep. VIII: The Last Jedi is a solid addition to the franchise, but it falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors. The pacing is uneven, some plot points feel forced, and the humor can be hit or miss. Still, it's worth watching for the impressive visuals and exciting action scenes.",
