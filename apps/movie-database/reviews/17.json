    "comment": "Black Panther is a solid superhero movie that has a lot of great elements, but doesn't quite live up to the hype. The cast is great, the visuals are impressive, and the story is interesting, but there are some pacing issues and the villain is a bit underdeveloped. Still worth watching though.",
